In 'Hosts' -> 'Operating Systems' -> Ubuntu Bionic It looks like templates are set to 'default-userdata'

Lets clone it and make our own.

'Hosts' -> 'Provisioning Templates' -> 'default-userdata' -> 'Clone'

  -> Name: custom-baremetal-userdata
  -> Association Tab: Move over all of them
  -> Submit

'Hosts' -> 'Operating Systems' -> (select os) -> 'Templates' -> User data template: custom-baremetal-userdata
